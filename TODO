There should probably be some
jarvis:createConfiguration(Host,Channel(s),User(s)) function to make default
configuration and write it.

Then start/0 could have error checking to see that ~/.jarvis.d actually exists,
and if not, print an error message prompting user to first run
createConfiguration(H,C,U)
